# Algorithms
A simple collection of sorting algorithms and data structures. The main purpose of this repository is review some algorithms focusing on complexity and analysis, while practicing new tools.

#Notes
Starting to define a model to develop:
	-Use framework to code/test using integers typer.
	-Use especific folder to store generic program.

TODO:
	-Define how to include analisys and compare the algorithms efficiently.
